<b>Acquiring Land in Uganda
 February 17, 2015</b></br>Admin
On  14th/
Feb 2015  representatives from Land Department Kabarole District
were hosted
live on Hits Fm to comment, discuss and share issues related to land , the Panelists included Kugonza Simon Peter Surveyor officer and Mr Alinda Peter Senior land
managing Officer both from Kabarole District.  some of the key issues they discussed included  during the live talkshow included: Do you think
Ugandan know the right processes of acquiring and buying a land in
Uganda? Do you know why and when you should survey your land? Do you
know the land title deeds in Uganda?etc
How a Ugandan can acquire land?</br></br>
 

According to the Uganda Law,</b> Land
is recognized in one way or the other and Land belongs to people but
this phase does not mean that every land you see is your land meaning that, some land is
owned by the culture leaders, some land is  for the community, there is Mile
land , Government land , forest land etc, so before anyone acquire land he should first have clear information about the type of land he/she wants</br>
to acquire and who owns the land. This should be the first step and
other steps will follow, like surveying, registering and getting a
title. Said Kugonza Simon Peter Kabarole district Surveyor during the talkshow
 Simon Peter adds a licensed surveyor then must visit the property to establish the boundaries.
Depending on size and location, this can take up to three days. When
this has been done, the transfer forms is submitted to the Land Office
to receive consent to transfer.</br></br>
<b>How to acquire a land title and why people are encouraged to have  land titles for their land?</b></br>

The process of getting a land title is not very long and everyone can
get a title for his or her land, first step is after acquiring the
land,</br> the owner must get in touch with the registered surveying
company,</br> where the company will approach the lands board and get
instructions to survey the land, measuring the land ,</br> putting the land
boundaries and provide the lands department with a report,</br>then
report will be submitted to Kampala for approval and copies will be
kept for future reference and the company will be told what to do next
.Once you get a land title, of your land you can use it to get a loan,</br>
for security purpose of your land no one can take it away by force, for
future reference etc. Said Mr Alinde Peter Senior land managing Officer
both from Kabarole District.</br></br>
Alinda adds the 1995 Constitution grants land ownership rights solely to citizens of
Uganda. Foreigners cannot own land freehold.Foreign investors, individual or corporate,
cannot acquire land for the purpose of crop or animal production.
Foreigners can either rent/lease from citizens or from the Government.</br>
